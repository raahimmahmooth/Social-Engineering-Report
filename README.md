# Social Engineering: Threats, Techniques, and Mitigation  

## 📌 Overview  
This report was developed as part of my **university coursework** during my **2nd year, 1st semester** at the **Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT)**. It provides an in-depth analysis of **social engineering**—a critical cybersecurity threat that exploits human psychology to manipulate individuals into revealing confidential information.  

## 📖 Key Topics Discussed  
✔ **Evolution of Social Engineering** – From historical deception techniques like the Trojan Horse to AI-driven attacks.  
✔ **Attack Lifecycle** – Information gathering, building trust, exploitation, and execution phases.  
✔ **Types of Attacks** – Phishing, baiting, impersonation, pretexting, and other deceptive strategies.  
✔ **Psychological Manipulation** – How attackers exploit trust, fear, urgency, and authority.  
✔ **Impacts** – Financial losses, reputational damage, and psychological effects on individuals and organizations.  
✔ **Defense Strategies** – Security policies, auditing, cybersecurity awareness, multi-factor authentication, and endpoint protection.  
✔ **Future Trends** – AI-generated phishing, deepfake attacks, IoT vulnerabilities, and behavioral biometrics exploitation.  

## 🔬 Research Focus  
This project is based on **academic research, real-world case studies, and industry reports**, highlighting the evolving nature of social engineering threats. It emphasizes the importance of **awareness training, security policies, and advanced cybersecurity tools** to combat these attacks.
